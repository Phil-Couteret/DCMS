# ‚úÖ New Booking Page - ROUTING ISSUE FIXED

**Issue:** New booking page was empty due to routing configuration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Routing properly configured

---

## üîß **Problem Identified**

The error message `No routes matched location "/bookings/new"` revealed the issue:

- **Root Cause:** React Router wasn't configured to handle `/bookings/new` path
- **Symptom:** Page appeared empty because route didn't exist
- **Impact:** New booking form couldn't be accessed

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Updated App.jsx Routing**
```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path="/bookings" element={<Bookings />} />
  <Route path="/bookings/new" element={<Bookings />} />      // ‚úÖ ADDED
  <Route path="/bookings/:id" element={<Bookings />} />     // ‚úÖ ADDED
  <Route path="/customers" element={<Customers />} />
  <Route path="/equipment" element={<Equipment />} />
  <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
</Routes>
```

### **2. Updated Bookings.jsx Component**
- **Replaced:** `useSearchParams` with `useParams` and `useLocation`
- **Updated:** Navigation to use proper URL paths
- **Fixed:** Route parameter handling

**Before:**
```jsx
const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
const mode = searchParams.get('mode');
const bookingId = searchParams.get('id');
// Navigate to: /bookings?mode=new
```

**After:**
```jsx
const { id } = useParams();
const location = useLocation();
const isNewMode = location.pathname === '/bookings/new';
// Navigate to: /bookings/new
```

### **3. Updated Navigation Links**
- **New Booking Button:** Now navigates to `/bookings/new`
