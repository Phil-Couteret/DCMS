# Market Size: Catalonia (Spain) & Occitanie (France)

**Purpose:** Estimate the number of **dive centers** and **bike / surf / kite / paddle** providers in Catalonia and Occitanie for DCMS target market sizing.

**Date:** January 2026  
**Sources:** ScubaGo, PADI, FFESSM, Longitude 181, tourism boards, GPPL, Yumping, web search. Counts are approximate; many directories overlap or under‑count.

## 1. Catalonia (Spain)

### 1.1 Dive centers

| Source | Area | Count | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| **ScubaGo** | Costa Brava | **31** | Girona coast, Medes, Cap de Creus |
| **ScubaGo** | Barcelona | **11** | City + Maresme |
| **ScubaGo** | Islas Medas | **6** | Subset of Costa Brava; overlap possible |
| **Diving Pass / earlier** | Catalonia | **20+** | Minimum from lists |
| **PADI** | Catalonia | — | Directory exists; no total published |

**Estimate:** **~35–50** dive centers (professional operations). Costa Brava is the main hub; Barcelona and Costa Dorada (Tarragona) add more. Islas Medas / L’Estartit alone have multiple centers.

---

### 1.2 Surf schools

| Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Escola Catalana de Surf** | Barcelona, Castelldefels, Montgat; FES/ISA accredited |
| **Others** | Various schools along coast; no official total |

**Estimate:** **5–15+** surf schools. Mediterranean coast has fewer spots than Atlantic; focus on Barcelona area and Costa Brava.

---

### 1.3 Kite schools

| Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Sant Pere Pescador** | Known kite spot (Girona) |
| **Various** | No comprehensive directory found |

**Estimate:** **~5–15** kite schools / providers. Less documented than dive or surf.

---

### 1.4 Stand‑up paddle (SUP) / paddleboard

| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Escola Catalana de Surf** | SUP lessons Barcelona / Castelldefels |
| **Eolis Kite** | Estartit (Costa Brava); lessons + rental |
| **Esportec** | La Mora, Tamarit (Costa Daurada) |
| **Molokai SUP Center** | Barceloneta |

**Estimate:** **~10–20+** SUP schools or rental providers. Often combined with surf or kite.

---

### 1.5 Bike rental

| Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Barcelona Rent a Bike** | 400+ bikes, 2 locations |
| **Others** | Many rentals in Barcelona, coastal resorts, cycling routes |

**Estimate:** **50–150+** bike rental operators (including small shops, hotels, resorts). No consolidated count; “bike rental” is broader than “dive center”.

---

### 1.6 Summary – Catalonia

| Activity | Low | High | Notes |
|----------|-----|------|--------|
| **Dive centers** | **35** | **50** | Best documented; ScubaGo + PADI |
| **Surf schools** | 5 | 15 | Mediterranean limited |
| **Kite schools** | 5 | 15 | Few directories |
| **SUP / paddle** | 10 | 20 | Often with surf/kite |
| **Bike rental** | 50 | 150 | Very broad market |

**Total “centers” (dive + surf + kite + SUP + bike):** **~100–250** (order of magnitude). Many bike-only; dive is the most clearly defined segment.

---

## 2. Occitanie (France)

### 2.1 Dive centers

| Source | Area | Count | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| **GPPL / Hérault Tourisme** | Hérault | **~10–12** | Pro centers Carnon–Sète (e.g. Abyss, Eurêka, Aventure, Ecosystem, Bulles, Nico, Plongée Passion, Esprit, etc.) |
| **Pyrénées-Orientales** | P‑O | **~2–5** | e.g. Archipel Plongée Argelès, CIP Collioure |
| **Longitude 181** | Méditerranée | **11** | Eco‑focused; may include non‑Occitanie |
| **FFESSM** | France | **2 500** clubs | All France; mix asociatif + pro |

**Estimate:** **~15–25** professional dive centers in Occitanie (mainly Hérault + P‑O coast). More if including Aude, Gard littoral, and clubs.

---

### 2.2 Surf schools

| Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **PALAWÄI SURF SCHOOL** | Palavas (Hérault); first surf school in Languedoc‑Roussillon (2012) |
| **Others** | Mediterranean surf limited; few dedicated schools |

**Estimate:** **1–5** surf schools. Most French surf is Atlantic (Landes, Basque).

---

### 2.3 Kite schools

| Source | Area | Count |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Leucate / Le Barcarès** | Etang de Salses‑Leucate | **4+** (Kite School Leucate, Kitepulsion, Chinook, Surf and Kite) |
| **Other lagoons** | — | More likely |

**Estimate:** **~5–15** kite schools. Leucate / Barcarès is a major kite hotspot.

---

### 2.4 Stand‑up paddle (SUP)

Often offered by kite/surf schools (e.g. Kite School Leucate, Chinook, Palawäi). No separate count.

**Estimate:** **~5–15** SUP providers (schools or rentals).

---

### 2.5 Bike rental

| **Examples** | Location vélos (P‑O), Le Petit Cyclo (Toulouse), L’Estapa (Saint‑Gaudens), liO |

**Estimate:** **100–500+** rental points. “500+” is broad; dedicated “bike rental centers” like DCMS bike_rental are a subset.

---

### 2.6 Summary – Occitanie

| Activity | Low | High | Notes |
|----------|-----|------|--------|
| **Dive centers** | **15** | **25** | Hérault + P‑O |
| **Surf schools** | 1 | 5 | Med coast |
| **Kite schools** | 5 | 15 | Leucate/Barcarès + |
| **SUP / paddle** | 5 | 15 | Overlap with kite/surf |
| **Bike rental** | 100 | 500 | Very wide definition |

**Total “centers” (same logic as Catalonia):** **~125–560**. Again, bike dominates by number; dive is well‑defined but smaller.

---

## 3. Combined snapshot

| Region | Dive | Surf | Kite | SUP | Bike | **Total (range)** |
|--------|------|------|------|-----|------|--------------------|
| **Catalonia** | 35–50 | 5–15 | 5–15 | 10–20 | 50–150 | **~100–250** |
| **Occitanie** | 15–25 | 1–5 | 5–15 | 5–15 | 100–500 | **~125–560** |
| **Total** | **50–75** | **6–20** | **10–30** | **15–35** | **150–650** | **~225–810** |

- **Dive:** **~50–75** centers across both regions (Catalonia > Occitanie).
- **Bike:** Largest segment by count; least comparable to “one center = one DCMS location”.
- **Surf / kite / SUP:** Smaller, often same operators; overlap likely.

---

## 4. Caveats & use for DCMS

1. **Definitions:** “Dive center” = professional operation (PADI/SSI/FFESSM, etc.). “Bike rental” can mean anything from a single shop to a hotel.
2. **Overlap:** Many operators do dive + SUP, or surf + kite + SUP; one business can span several categories.
3. **Directories:** ScubaGo, PADI, FFESSM, GPPL, Longitude 181 all differ in scope; totals are indicative, not census.
4. **DCMS‑relevant:**  
   - **Dive:** Strong fit; **~50–75** centers in Catalonia + Occitanie.  
   - **Bike:** Large potential base, but “center” and “management software” need defining.  
   - **Surf / kite / SUP:** Smaller, often same outlets as dive or bike; good for multi‑activity DCMS locations.

---

## 5. Sources (summary)

- **ScubaGo** – Catalonia dive areas (Costa Brava, Barcelona, Medes).  
- **PADI** – Dive shop directory Catalonia / Spain (no totals).  
- **FFESSM** – French federative structure; 2 500 clubs France‑wide.  
- **GPPL, Hérault Tourisme, Escapades LR** – Hérault dive centers.  
- **Longitude 181** – Mediterranean eco‑dive centers.  
- **Tourisme Occitanie** – Bike rental “500+”, kite spots, cycling.  
- **Leucate / Barcarès** – Kite school lists.  
- **Yumping, Diving Pass** – Catalonia dive / activities.  
- **Web search** – Surf, SUP, bike examples in both regions.

---

**Next steps:**  
- Cross‑check with PADI/SSI/FFESSM locators for exact dive center counts.  
- Define “addressable” bike market (e.g. managed multi‑day rental, tours) for DCMS.  
- Use **~50–75** dive centers as a conservative TAM for Catalonia + Occitanie when modelling SaaS uptake.
