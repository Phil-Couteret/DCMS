- **Modular Compliance:** Activity-specific compliance requirements (dive logs, safety checks) as plugins

**Adding New Activities (e.g., Water Sports):**
1. **Database Configuration:** Add new activity type with requirements and pricing
2. **Equipment Setup:** Define equipment categories and inventory
3. **Staff Training:** Add activity-specific qualifications to staff profiles
4. **Compliance Rules:** Configure any required safety or regulatory procedures
5. **Frontend Updates:** Add activity to booking interface (no backend changes needed)

**Example: Adding Kayak Rentals**
```json
{
  "activity": {
    "name": "Kayak Rental",
    "type": "water_sports",
    "category": "rental",
    "base_price": 25,
    "duration": 120,
    "equipment_requirements": ["kayak", "paddle", "life_vest"],
