### 4.5 Real-time Features

**WebSocket Implementation:**

```typescript
// Real-time Updates
interface WebSocketEvents {
  // Booking Updates
  'booking:created': (booking: Booking) => void;
  'booking:updated': (booking: Booking) => void;
  'booking:cancelled': (bookingId: string) => void;

}
```

### 4.6 Security Architecture

**Multi-Layer Security:**

```typescript
// Authentication & Authorization
interface SecurityLayer {
  // JWT Token Management
  generateToken(userId: string, role: string, locationId?: string): string;
  validateToken(token: string): UserPayload;
  refreshToken(refreshToken: string): string;
  
  // Role-Based Access Control
  checkPermission(userId: string, resource: string, action: string): boolean;
  getLocationAccess(userId: string): string[];
  
  // Data Encryption
  encryptSensitiveData(data: any): string;
  decryptSensitiveData(encryptedData: string): any;
  
  // API Rate Limiting
  checkRateLimit(ip: string, endpoint: string): boolean;
  incrementRateLimit(ip: string, endpoint: string): void;
}

// Security Middleware Stack
const securityMiddleware = [
  helmet(),                    // Security headers
  cors(corsOptions),          // Cross-origin requests
  rateLimit(rateLimitConfig), // Rate limiting
  authenticateToken,          // JWT authentication
  authorizeUser,              // Role-based authorization
  validateLocationAccess,     // Location-specific access
  sanitizeInput,              // Input sanitization
  validateRequest,            // Request validation
];
```

### 4.7 Data Synchronization

**Multi-Location Data Sync:**

```typescript
// Real-time Synchronization
class DataSyncService {
  // Cross-location booking sync
  syncBookingAcrossLocations(bookingId: string): void {
    // Update availability across all locations
    // Notify relevant staff
    // Update customer profile
  }
  
  // Equipment transfer tracking
  trackEquipmentTransfer(equipmentId: string, fromLocation: string, toLocation: string): void {
    // Update equipment location
    // Log transfer in audit trail
    // Notify receiving location
  }
  
  // Customer profile sync
  syncCustomerProfile(customerId: string): void {
    // Update customer data across locations
    // Sync loyalty points
    // Update preferences
  }
  
  // Real-time availability updates
  updateAvailability(locationId: string, activityId: string, date: string): void {
    // Recalculate availability
    // Broadcast to connected clients
    // Update cache
  }
}
```

### 4.8 Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching:**

```typescript
// Cache Configuration
const cacheConfig = {
  // Redis Cache (Session & Application Data)

```

### 4.12 Volume Discount Management

**Tiered Pricing System:**

```typescript
// Volume Discount Configuration
interface VolumeDiscountConfig {
  diving: {
    basePrice: 46.00;           // Base price per dive
    tiers: [
      { min: 1, max: 2, price: 46.00, discount: 0.00 },    // 1-2 dives: €46
      { min: 3, max: 5, price: 44.00, discount: 4.35 },    // 3-5 dives: €44 (4.35% off)
      { min: 6, max: 8, price: 42.00, discount: 8.70 },    // 6-8 dives: €42 (8.70% off)
      { min: 9, max: null, price: 38.00, discount: 17.39 } // 9+ dives: €38 (17.39% off)
    ];
  };
}

// Volume Discount Service
class VolumeDiscountService {
  calculateVolumePrice(activityId: string, quantity: number): VolumePriceResult {
    const config = this.getVolumeConfig(activityId);
    const applicableTier = config.tiers.find(tier => 
      quantity >= tier.min && (tier.max === null || quantity <= tier.max)
    );
    
    if (!applicableTier) {
      throw new Error('No applicable pricing tier found');
    }
    
    const totalPrice = applicableTier.price * quantity;
    const totalSavings = (config.basePrice - applicableTier.price) * quantity;
    
    return {
      pricePerUnit: applicableTier.price,
      totalPrice: totalPrice,
      totalSavings: totalSavings,
      discountPercentage: applicableTier.discount,
      tierApplied: `${applicableTier.min}-${applicableTier.max || '∞'} dives`
    };
  }
  
  getVolumeDiscountPreview(activityId: string): VolumeDiscountPreview[] {
    const config = this.getVolumeConfig(activityId);
    return config.tiers.map(tier => ({
      quantity: `${tier.min}-${tier.max || '∞'}`,
      pricePerDive: tier.price,
      discount: tier.discount,
      savings: tier.discount > 0 ? `Save €${(config.basePrice - tier.price).toFixed(2)} per dive` : 'Base price'
    }));
  }
}
```

**Volume Discount Examples:**

```typescript
// Example: Customer booking 6 dives
const volumePrice = volumeDiscountService.calculateVolumePrice('diving', 6);
// Result:
// {
//   pricePerUnit: 42.00,
//   totalPrice: 252.00,
//   totalSavings: 24.00,
//   discountPercentage: 8.70,
//   tierApplied: "6-8 dives"
// }

// Example: Volume discount preview for customer
const preview = volumeDiscountService.getVolumeDiscountPreview('diving');
// Result:
// [
//   { quantity: "1-2", pricePerDive: 46.00, discount: 0.00, savings: "Base price" },
//   { quantity: "3-5", pricePerDive: 44.00, discount: 4.35, savings: "Save €2.00 per dive" },
//   { quantity: "6-8", pricePerDive: 42.00, discount: 8.70, savings: "Save €4.00 per dive" },
//   { quantity: "9-∞", pricePerDive: 38.00, discount: 17.39, savings: "Save €8.00 per dive" }
// ]
```

### 4.13 Admin Pricing Management System

**User-Friendly Pricing Configuration (No Development Required):**

```typescript
// Admin Pricing Interface
interface AdminPricingManager {
  // Visual pricing dashboard
  pricingDashboard: {
    viewAllPricing(): PricingOverview;
    editPrice(activityId: string, newPrice: number): boolean;
    bulkUpdatePricing(updates: PricingUpdate[]): boolean;
    viewPriceHistory(activityId: string): PriceHistory[];
  };
  
  // Special pricing management
  specialPricing: {
    addResidentDiscount(activityId: string, discount: number): boolean;
    addWeekendSpecial(activityId: string, conditions: SpecialConditions): boolean;
    updateSpecialPricing(pricingId: string, updates: Partial<SpecialPricing>): boolean;
    deactivateSpecialPricing(pricingId: string): boolean;
  };
  
  // Volume discount management
  volumeDiscounts: {
    updateTier(activityId: string, tier: VolumeTier): boolean;
    addNewTier(activityId: string, tier: VolumeTier): boolean;
    removeTier(tierId: string): boolean;
  };
  
  // Validation and safety
  validation: {
    validatePricing(pricing: any): ValidationResult;
    previewPricingImpact(updates: PricingUpdate[]): PricingImpact;
    rollbackPricing(pricingId: string): boolean;
  };
}

// Example: Adding resident pricing when determined
const addResidentPricing = async (activityId: string, discountPercentage: number) => {
  const specialPricing = {
    name: 'Canary Islands Resident Discount',
    discount_percentage: discountPercentage,
    conditions: {
      residency: 'canary_islands',
      document_required: 'residencia'
    },
    requirements: ['canary_resident', 'valid_residencia'],
    is_active: true
  };
  
  return await adminPricingManager.specialPricing.addResidentDiscount(activityId, discountPercentage);
};
```
