# Frontend Improvements Without Backend

**Current Status:** Frontend working with localStorage mock data  
**Goal:** Enhance features and prepare for backend integration

## ‚úÖ **What We Can Do Right Now**

### **1. Prepare API Service Layer** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Why:** Easy transition when backend is ready

Create an API abstraction layer:
